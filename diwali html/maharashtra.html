<img src="maharashtrapic.jpg">
<p>Hindus in Maharashtra celebrate Diwali for four days with Vasubaras being the first day and marked by performing an Aarti of the cows and calves to signify love between a mother and her baby. Dhanteras or Dhanatrayodashi is celebrated on Day 2 while the third day is Narakchaturdashi where people take scented oil bath early morning and visit a temple, then feast on a special Diwali preparation called Faral which consists of delicious sweets like “karanji” and “ladoo” and spicy eatables like “chakli” and “sev” and the fourth day is the main Diwali day when Lakshmi Puja is performed by worshipping Lakshmi and items of wealth like money and jewellery.</p>
